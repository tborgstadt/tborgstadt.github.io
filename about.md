Hello!

I have always had an affinity for collecting, finessing, and using data to make decisions. Meaningful trustworthy data provides a basis for logical and reasoned decision making. However, many times interpreting or finding meaning in the data requires engineering, experimentation, curiosity, and the will and tenacity to keep looking when answers don't come easily or quickly. It is this very pursuit of hidden meaning and value that makes me happy.

I began my career as a software developer and was soon recognized for my ability to build relationships, so I was promoted into management early. I continued to contribute technically to integration projects and proof of concepts. Staying technically capable and up to date has always been important to me.

My endeavor is to redirect my career into a more data centric path that effectively utilizes both my desire to work directly with business users and leaders, while allowing my creative technical side to explore and deliver solutions that add value to the bottom line.
